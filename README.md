# Tyler_Porfolio

This is the first iteration of my portfolio. It includes: 
* Responsiveness for Mobile viewing
* Flexboxes
* CSS-DNA from Ricardo Rojas Cruz (Github: https://gist.github.com/kiritodeveloper)
* FormSubmit to handle direct emails.

Issues to improve:
* Socials tab on Home page is too small for mobile, should not use rem for width but percentage.
* DNA sequence turns in on itself on very small screens.

Next Iteration Goals:
* Add JavaScript for API calls
* Fix aforementioned errors
* Favicon
